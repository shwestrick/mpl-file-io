First attempt:
  open BinIO
  val (reader: BinIO.StreamIO.reader, vec: Word8Vector.vector) =
    StreamIO.getReader (getInstream (openIn pathToFile))
(note also that reader: BinPrimIO.reader)
BUT the problem is that getReader essentially performs an inputAll.

Alternatively, could do
  open Poxis.FileSys
  val file: file_desc = openf (pathToFile, O_RDONLY, O.fromWord 0w0)
but file_desc objects don't seem to be readable? We can do fdToIOD
to get a OS.IO.iodesc but this doesn't help...
